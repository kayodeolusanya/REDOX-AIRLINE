# REDOX-AIRLINE
I am a consultant working with a small startup airline,
operating out of the Chicago, Illinois area in the United
States.

The airline's management team has a strong airline
operations background, but donâ€™t have much financial or
data analytics experience. Many of their systems are
disparate and not connected. Until just recently, the airline could not pull specific
aircraft details, such as route and seating capacity, from a
single report, but rather needed to open two or more files
and compare the information.
You have been requested by the CEO to analyze the data and
present key insights to drive the business growth and
position in the industry.
